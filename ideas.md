**Design Movement**: Swiss International Style (Modernist)
**Core Principles**: Clarity, Objectivity, Grid-based precision, Asymmetry
**Color Philosophy**: Deep Navy (#0D1B3F) as the anchor, Gold (#F2B81C) for high-contrast accents, and vast amounts of white/light grey for breathing room. The goal is to convey trust, authority, and unwavering focus.
**Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric grid systems. Content is aligned with mathematical precision but not centered. Use of negative space to guide the eye.
**Signature Elements**:
- Thick, bold horizontal rules (lines) to separate sections.
- Large, oversized typography for headlines.
- Geometric shapes (circles, squares) derived from the logo's "orbit" concept.
**Interaction Philosophy**: "Snap" and "Precision". Interactions should feel instant and solid, like a well-oiled machine. No bouncy springs; just precise transitions.
**Animation**:
- Elements slide in from the sides along the grid lines.
- Hover effects are sharp color inversions or underline expansions.
**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Helvetica Now Display or similar Neo-Grotesque (Bold/Black).
- Body: Inter or Roboto (Regular/Medium) for high legibility.
- Hierarchy: Extreme contrast in size between headings and body text.

**Design Movement**: Dark Mode Futurism / "Glassmorphism" Lite
**Core Principles**: Depth, Layering, Glow, Focus
**Color Philosophy**: The Deep Navy (#0D1B3F) becomes the background. Gold (#F2B81C) is used for glowing gradients and "light sources". White is used for text with varying opacity. This conveys a sense of "cutting edge" technology and "inner focus".
**Layout Paradigm**: Floating cards and sections. Content sits on semi-transparent layers that blur the background.
**Signature Elements**:
- Subtle background gradients that shift slowly (representing "Momentum").
- Glass-like cards for the "Tools" (GrowDis/G.A.S.) to make them feel tangible.
- Orbit lines (thin, fading strokes) that traverse the page.
**Interaction Philosophy**: "Flow" and "Ethereal". Interactions should feel weightless and smooth.
**Animation**:
- Parallax scrolling effects for background elements.
- Soft fades and blurs for content entry.
- Buttons that "glow" on hover.
**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Space Grotesk or Exo 2 (Futuristic but readable).
- Body: DM Sans or similar geometric sans.
- Hierarchy: Defined by brightness and weight rather than just size.

**Design Movement**: Editorial / "The New Yorker" meets Tech
**Core Principles**: Narrative, Sophistication, Serenity, Human-Centric
**Color Philosophy**: Soft white/cream background. Deep Navy (#0D1B3F) for text and primary elements. Gold (#F2B81C) used very sparingly like jewelryâ€”only for the most critical actions. This conveys "wisdom" and "thoughtful planning".
**Layout Paradigm**: Single-column narrative flow for the main story, breaking into multi-column for features. Feels like reading a high-end magazine article.
**Signature Elements**:
- Serif typography for headlines to add warmth and authority.
- High-quality photography or abstract illustrations that look hand-drawn/organic.
- "Margin notes" or sidebars for supporting points.
**Interaction Philosophy**: "Unfolding". As you scroll, the story reveals itself gently.
**Animation**:
- Text reveals (fade up).
- Images that scale slightly on scroll.
- Smooth, slow scrolling feel.
**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Playfair Display or Merriweather (Serif).
- Body: Lato or Source Sans Pro (Humanist Sans).
- Hierarchy: Elegant, using italics and spacing to differentiate.
